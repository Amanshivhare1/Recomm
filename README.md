Movie Recommender System

This is a movie recommender system which uses the "tmdb-5000-movie-dataset" from kaggle. I have done the pre processing and created a final column named 'tags' which is the main hero of model.
Then i have vectorize the tags column so that I can use it in my model training. And at last trained a Cosine Similarity model which predits the values related using radian distance.
